<p> My name is Caleb Parker, I'm a 4th year computer science student. I am taking this course as a requirement, but more significantly to broaden my horizons in JavaScript and potentially SQL and better understand the web design process from a full-stack developers perspective. I am interested in learning which roles play to my strengths and where I need to improve in my coding skills. I look forward to this class mostly for the opportunity for project-building and engaging in strong team work for strong collaborative projects end goals. </p>
