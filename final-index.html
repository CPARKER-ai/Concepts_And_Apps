<h1> The Beginning </h1>
  
  <p> Programming languages have technically been around for centuries, and coding is no new technique found in human knowledge. However as it stands in the 21st century it is one of the most important skills for IT industry professionals to know and implement throughout their daily routines. Both in the public sector and the private sector. </p>

  <p> Coding now takes precedence in the forms of high-level languages instead of low-level languages. While the concept of coding is very intuitive it can easily be misunderstood due to a lack of understanding of computer systems, networks, architecture and computer organization concepts.</p>

  <p> The most notable architects who advanced programming and the foundations of computer science include(but are not limited to): Alan Turing, deemed as the father of computer science, John Von Nueman renowned mathematician and computer scientist, Ada Lovelace considered as the first computer programmer, Mark Dean IBM Fellow and inventor among others! </p>
