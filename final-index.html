<h1> The Beginning </h1>
  
  <p> My name is Caleb Parker, I'm a 4th year computer science student. I am taking this course as a requirement, but more importantly to broaden my horizons in JavaScript and potentially SQL and better understand the web design process from a full-stack developers perspective. 
    I am interested in learning which roles play to my strengths and where I need to improve in my coding skills. I look forward to this class mostly for the opportunity to build projects and engage in strong teamwork toward meaningful collaborative goals.  </p>

  <p> Also, a couple of my academic interests involve learning about history, learning from documentaries and video essays, engaging in intellectual conversations about societal problems and learning about different cultural backgrounds and systems of thought. 
      Furthermore a couple of my hobbies include playing chess, playing the violin, endurance running, playing basketball, playing PC games and hanging out with friends.
 </p>
  
  <p> Fun fact about myself: I was the 2024 HBCU chess champion for FAMU!! </p>
